cephgeorep (1.2.8-1bionic) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Signigicant optimizations for modifying file paths and for comparing
    file size and type to make crawl time up to 6 times faster.
  * Lowered memory usage by using iterators and c-string pointers rather
    than copying the vector of file objects into partitions to distribute
    paths amongst sync processes.
  * Make systemd service restart on abnormal exit (killed by signal).
